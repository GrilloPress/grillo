I've started this blog with two aims:

- To learn more CSS
- To collect and publish things I have learned as an interaction designer

## Keeping it simple

I am going to try and keep the blog design simple.

As little CSS as possible. With a very small and strict set of CSS for the blog as a whole.

I am going to add a flourish here and there for particular blog posts. Like a grid for the Design Kanban post I am writing which shows the shape of the physical board.

## Using CSS grid

This blog uses CSS grid.

At first glance CSS grid looks a little intimidating.

Creating this blog is a way for me to learn it.

 I’ve got a simple two column layout (converting to a single column on mobile) in 13 lines of CSS (Scss). The CSS is below:

```SCSS
.container {

  max-width: 1100px;
  margin: auto;
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 3fr 1fr;
  grid-gap: 2rem;
  padding: 1rem;

  @media screen and (max-width: $mobile) {
    grid-template-columns: 100%;
  }
}
```

Before I created my first layout, that code would have looked intimidating.

As I get a better handle on it. I will write it up in an article.
